According to my understanding , The four agreements is a book that talks about the four agreements/traits that you should inculcate/make part of your life , that makes your life easy and peaceful .

### The First agreement : Be impeccable with your word

This first agreement literally means that your word / what you talk should be impeccable , which means that it should not be sinful . But , basically what the author tries to explain here is the power of the word i.e. communication . How the word makes your life heaven/hell 
based on your usage . 
Basically we as humans are the only species in the universe that can able to talk/communicate . And impeccable with it meaning  is one should not go against oneself , like whenever someone speaks/tells something about you they leave a spell on you , If the spell is positive , that
will improve the opposite person's life and to the person who is speaking also . Because it depends on the basic principal that what you give is what you get . if you love someone , they will love you back , if you hate someone , they will hate you back , if you are selfish with someon,
mostly likely they will be selfish with you . But , what the author might be missing here is that sometimes it might be far from reality , you dont need to necessarily get love back if you love someone , and you should be ok with it . The author misses to talk about this real
life concept and assumed theoretical scenarios . But , that might work sometimes too , so good to follow it . 

And as i was saying when someone speaks or you speak to someone , you/they will leave a spell on  you . lets say i told you that you are beautiful ,so now you will be happy and most likely you will have a positive perception on me . or else if say that you are a stupid , then 
most likely you will believe that you are stupid , which will lower your confidence and most likely you will develop a negative perspective on me . But , sometimes it is necessary to criticize and say to someone that they are stupid , if they really are which will save them to
become worst , author didnt talk about it .

And , he talks about how we sometimes spews venom against our own loved ones , to make our point correct . our opinions are just our observations which need not to be true , and you dont need to talk negative about your loved ones just to make your point correct , or to seem like
you are correct and they are wrong in front of everyone . Personally i could relate to this , sometimes i talked negatively about pepole whom i like , infront of them or infront of some other people , which we should never do .

The author talked about how hitler used the word to destroy the world with hateful speeches and by planting hate in people's minds . According to author , the mind is fertile ,so it depends on you what seeds you are gonna plant in this fertile land , if you plant a fear seed , 
then you will be fearful most of the time , so plant a love seed , and love other humans , afterall we all are living in this planet temporirarily (the last sentnece is mine though)
